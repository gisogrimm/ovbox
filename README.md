# ORLANDOviols Consort box (ovbox)

The ovbox is a remote collaboration box developed by the ensemble [ORLANDOviols](http://orlandoviols.com) primarily to allow rehearsals during the lockdown due to Covid19 pandemia. This box is completely built upon open source software and open or standardized hardware.

## Performance

We use this box since April 15th 2020, almost every day. The software is optimized continouosly. With the current settings we achieve delays between musicians ranging from 40ms (optical fiber network/DSL) and 67ms (connection via mobile network), with a tolerable amount of dropouts. This delay contains the network transmission time, the jitter buffer (currently 14ms), and the delay of the audio hardware (currently 11ms). We connect 4-5 devices.

The device sends 16bit audio at 48 kHz sampling rate. The signal is rendered to headphones using virtual 3D audio. Streaming to platforms such as youtube is possible using a session on a PC, with OBS studio and other pro-audio software.

## Architecture

On a central server (or one endpoint reachable from outside) the multiplexer/tunnel server `mplx_server` needs to be running. This listens at a single UDP port. The boxes connect to this server with the multiplexer client software `mplx_client` and  can receive UDP messages from the other participants sent their client software. UDP messages sent to the local client are transferred to the server. To minimize data manipulation, the packages are protected by a 32bit secret (but not encrypted).

At each endpoint, one intance of zita-n2j is started for each potential participant. One instance of zita-j2n is started on each box to stream the local audio to the other participants. The session management and audio mixing is performed in TASCAR.

The underlying adaptive resampling of zita-njbridge is described in [https://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/papers/adapt-resamp.pdf](https://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/papers/adapt-resamp.pdf).

A simple mixing interface is provided with `node-js` and some TASCAR extensions. This mixer interface can be opened from any html5-compatible browser in the same network as the ovbox, and is optimized for smartphone/touch use.

## Starting the tools

On our boxes, TASCAR is not only used for virtual acoustic simulation, but also for the whole session management. Essentially, on each client these commands are started:

````
jackd --sync -P 40 -d alsa -d hw:US2x2 -r 48000 -p 96 -n 2
````

This starts the audio backend. `--sync` is required for delay optimization, since jackd2 uses one extra block in multi-threading mode. `-P 40` sets realtime priority - this can be adjusted, especially on realtime patched kernels, to the system requirements and potential rtirq settings. `-d alsa` selects ALSA driver. `-d hw:US2x2` is the TASCAM US2x2 audio device. `-r 48000` is the sampling rate. Again, for delay optimization it is advisable to use a period size which is a multiple of 1 ms, since USB audio protocol transmits 1ms chunks. To allow this, a sampling rate of 48000 Hz is preferred over 44100 Hz. `-p 96` sets the fragment size to 2 ms. `-n 2` sets to use two buffers (which is the default anyway).

````
mplx_client -d mplx.yourdomain.com -p 4464 -l 4464 -c 0
````
This starts the multiplexer/tunnel client. `-d mplx.yourdomain.com` sets the remote server name, `-p 4464` the remote server port. `-l 4464` is the local port, to which UDP messages can be sent. `-c 0` sets the caller/client ID to 0. This is the participant number within the session, currently numbers up to 31 are supported.

````
zita-n2j --chan 1 --jname Marthe --buff 15 0.0.0.0 4466
zita-n2j --chan 1 --jname Frauke --buff 17 0.0.0.0 4468
zita-n2j --chan 1 --jname Hille --buff 19 0.0.0.0 4470
zita-n2j --chan 1 --jname Claas --buff 14 0.0.0.0 4472
````

These are the real audio clients. The `mplx_client` will distribute UDP messages from the server to these clients. The output of these clients can then used in jack for mixing (in our case spatialization with TASCAR, but any other panning/mixing could be possible). The jitter buffer is adjusted manually to the individual network quality - this should be replaced by a better interface in the future.

````
zita-j2n --chan 1 --jname sender --16bit 127.0.0.1 4464
````

This is the tool which sends the local microphone signal to the local UDP port of `mplx_client`, which will forward it to the server (or other clients).

In addition, some jack ports need to be connected:

````
jack_connect Marthe:out_1 render.scene:Marthe.0.0
jack_connect Frauke:out_1 render.scene:Frauke.0.0
jack_connect Hille:out_1 render.scene:Hille.0.0
jack_connect Claas:out_1 render.scene:Claas.0.0
jack_connect system:capture_1 sender:in_1
````
Here, `render.scene` is the TASCAR scene, which could be replaced by another mixer or simply by using the hardware outputs directly. The last line connects the first hardware input channel with the sender.

## mplx_tools

The tools `mplx_server` and `mplx_client` form the main communication protocol. They are essentially a STUN server and a TURN server, and provide a minimalistic session management.

## peer-to-peer mode vs server mode

The `mplx_client` / `mplx_server` tools support connection via server or a peer-to-peer mode. In both cases the central server is needed for negotiation of the participants. peer-to-peer mode can activated at the client with the `-2` flag. A mixed automatic switching between peer-to-peer mode and server mode based on the client behavior and statistics is currently under development.
