# Installation instructions

The installation instructions are probably incomplete, however, they may
give a rough idea of the steps involved. Any comments and improvements are
welcome!

To use the ovbox hardware or ov-client desktop application after
successful installation (e.g., for connecting with other users), you
will need an account on the configuration frontend
[https://box.orlandoviols.com/](https://box.orlandoviols.com/).

## Option 1: Download pre-configured raspios image

Download the modified installer image from
[https://box.orlandoviols.com/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-ovclientinstaller.zip](https://box.orlandoviols.com/2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-ovclientinstaller.zip)
and unpack it.

The md5sums of the packed and unpacked files are:
````
3cfae32b88b5d4753fc5bf46d5dd3ab9  2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-ovclientinstaller.img
22ee5cc2caa6147f26a38fb7822f1698  2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-ovclientinstaller.zip
````

Now with the Raspberry Pi imager, choose the image file by clicking
"CHOOSE OS" and "Use custom". Select the file
`2020-08-20-raspios-buster-armhf-lite-ovclientinstaller.img`. Select
the SD card and write to the card.

Before booting your Raspberry Pi, please make sure that

- it is connected to the internet with a cable
- a class compliant USB sound card is connected
- headphones are connected to the USB sound card
- the new SD card is inserted
- all HDMI cables are disconnected

Now you can power on the Raspberry Pi. After approximately 5 minutes,
you should hear an announcement in the headphones, and you can proceed
with the registration of the device
[wiki](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki#configuration-of-your-device).


## Option 2: Install with installer script

### Download and install raspbian

Download the Raspberry Pi OS image. The 'Lite' version is sufficient, since the system will be headless:

[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/)

If you use the 'Raspberry Pi Imager', choose 'Raspberry Pi OS (other)', 
then  'Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)'.

#### a) headless installation

To enable ssh access in a headless environment (no screen connected to the Pi), follow these instructions:
[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/). Essentially you need to create a file `ssh` in the `/boot` partition, e.g. with
````
touch /your/path/to/boot/ssh
````
After writing the image to the disk, you may need to re-insert the SD-card before you can create that file.

The next step is to insert the SD-card into the Raspberry Pi and boot it. Your PC and the Raspberry Pi should be in the same network.
Now you should be able to login via ssh, with
````
ssh pi@raspberrypi
````
The default password is `raspberry`. This needs to be changed after first boot; to change the password, type `passwd`.

#### b) installation via screen

Connect a screen (you will need a micro-HDMI cable) and a keyboard. 
Login as user 'pi'. Please note that the audio device numbering may change
when connecting an HDMI screen.

### ovbox installer script

At this point you may try to use our installer script. If everything goes well, you will have a ready-to-use ovbox. It may take about one hour to run. To use the installer script, type these commands as user pi:
````
wget https://github.com/gisogrimm/ov-client/raw/master/installovclient.sh
. installovclient.sh
````

Please mind the space between the dot and `installovbox.sh`. This
script will install all required packages, install and compile the
virtual acoustic simulation toolbox TASCAR and the ovbox tools. After
installation it will activated the overlay file system to protected
the SD card from write errors when powering off the device. Finally,
the system will restart.

If everything went well and if the sound card is connected,
approximately 1 minute after powering on the device you should hear an
announcement via headphones. Now you can claim the device in the web
interface - see the
[wiki](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki#configuration-of-your-device)
for details.  You may shutdown the device by simply unplugging the
power.

**Warning**: The installer script activates the overlay file system to
prevent a damage of the SD card when powering off the system. This
means that all changes you make after installation will be lost. The
overlay file system can be deactivated with:

````
sudo raspi-config nonint disable_overlayfs
sudo shutdown -r now
````

After applying changes it can be reactivated with:

````
sudo raspi-config nonint enable_overlayfs
sudo shutdown -r now
````

## Installation on an Ubuntu LTS desktop PC

If you plan to install the 'ov-client' application system on a x86 64
bit Ubuntu LTS system (other debian based systems may also work), it
is not recommended to use the installer described above.

In Ubuntu 20.04:

    wget -qO- https://apt.hoertech.de/openmha-packaging.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-add-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.hoertech.de focal universe'

In Ubuntu 18.04:

    wget -qO- https://apt.hoertech.de/openmha-packaging.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-add-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.hoertech.de bionic universe'

In Ubuntu 16.04:

    wget -qO- https://apt.hoertech.de/openmha-packaging.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-add-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.hoertech.de xenial universe'

In Debian Buster on ARM (Raspberry Pi):

    wget -qO- https://apt.hoertech.de/openmha-packaging.pub | sudo apt-key add -
    (echo "";echo "deb [arch=armhf] http://apt.hoertech.de bionic universe")|sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list


Then install the ov-client and all dependendies with

````
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --assume-yes ov-client
````

To start the system, open a terminal and type:

````
ov-client
````

You may now use the jack ports with your preferred audio
software. Please note that ports may disappear and re-appear after
remote configuration of your system or any of your peers. To ensure
persistent port connections you may use the 'extra ports' field in the
'expert settings' of the 'device settings' dialog.

A graphical desktop client and installer for all commonly used
operating systems is planned as part of the digital stage project.
